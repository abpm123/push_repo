First Dependency is require to In order to implement Spring security is --> spring-security-web

groupId 
org.springframework.security
artifactId
spring-security-web
Version
3.2.5 RELEASE
Another Dependency that is required to add is -->spring-security-config
(this will give us spring security namespace that actually
we are using in the spring security XML configuration)

groupId 
org.springframework.security
artifactId
spring-security-config
Version
3.2.5 RELEASE

In spring MVC our Dispacher Servlet is made to handle all the incoming http request which
we configured in in web.xml file . Next In order to implemnt Spring security we will take 
the advantage of Servlet filter which will be the first Interceptor for all the http in-coming 
request.and this will be entry point to implement spring security.Let  us see how we can do it

So First We need to define Filter Class in Web.xml 

<filter>
<filter-name>springSecuirtyfilterChain</filter-name>
<filter-class>org.sf.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
</filter>

and Next  we are suppose to define Filter Mapping

<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>springSecuirtyfilterChain</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>(Here This will entrcept every url)
</filter-mapping>

Next is to define listener which will allow us to work with other application Context
<listener>
<listener-class>org.sf.web.context.ContextLoaderListerner</listener-class>
</listener>

and Add applicationContext for Spring Security related Configuration . In order to bootstrap 
we define it into context - param

<context-param>
<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
<param-value>/WEB-INF/config/myDemoApp-securityConfig.xml</param-value>
</context-param>

Now Next Step is to create the "myDemoApp-securityConfig.xml" file in /WEB-INF/config folder
now next step is to provide name space for spring security in myDemoApp-securityConfig.xml
xmlns:security="http://www.sf.org/schema/security"

Now In order to provide basic in Memeory Authenticaton for Spring based application we need to 
do some configuration in  myDemoApp-securityConfig.xml

<security:http auto-config="true">--->This is for default settings
<security:intercept-url pattern ="/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>
</security:http>
Since we are doing in Memeory Authenticaton so In oder to do it we are going to define valid user and role
in myDemoApp-securityConfig.xml file . For that We use the tag <authentication-manager> </authentication-manager>
In the authentication manager we are going to set <authentication provider> . Inside <authentication provider> we
are using user-service tag where we are defing some valid user

<security:authentication-manager>
<security:authentication-provider>
<security:user-service>
<security:user name = "ANDY" password = "1234567" authorities="ROLE_USER"/>
<security:user name = "ANN" password = "7654321" authorities="ROLE_TRIAL_USER"/>
</security:user-service>
</security:authentication-provider>
 </<security:authentication-manager>

now we are done for In Memeory Authenticaton and Now if you run the application you will be intercepted and 
spring will provide you login page and then you can access this application.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Next we are going to how We can implement http basic authentication 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier we have seen Spring is providing default login form InOrder to access the application.
Now will see how we can implement http basic authentication for that only we need to add 

<security:http auto-config="true">--->This is for default settings
<security:intercept-url pattern ="/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>
<security:http-basic/>------> this the only additional thing required and we are done
</security:http>
